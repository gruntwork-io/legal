## Preface

<!--Plain English:
By using Gruntwork products and services, you agree to these Terms of Service. You must have a Gruntwork Subscription to use any Gruntwork services.
-->

Thank you for using the Gruntwork services. Gruntwork has developed and makes available a suite of DevOps products and services, including subscription-based offerings (the “Subscription Products”), collections of DevOps code and documentation (the “Library Products”), and other features, websites, user interfaces, content, applications and other deliverables associated with our services (collectively, the “Services”).

To be eligible to register for a Gruntwork account and use the Gruntwork Services, you must review and accept the terms of this Gruntwork Terms of Service (this “Agreement” or these “Terms”). PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OR USING THE GRUNTWORK SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WITH GRUNTWORK INC. (“Gruntwork”). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES.

In this Agreement, “you,” “your” and “Customer” will refer to you. If you are registering for a Gruntwork account or using the Services on behalf of an entity or other organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that entity or organization and representing to Gruntwork that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to these Terms (and, in which case, the terms “you”, “your” and “Customer” will refer to that entity or organization).

Gruntwork may revise these Terms from time to time. If Gruntwork does revise these Terms, the revised Terms will supersede prior versions. Revisions will be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms, unless you have purchased a paid subscription to the Gruntwork Services, in which case such revisions will be effective upon the next renewal of your subscription. Gruntwork will provide you advance notice of any material revisions. This notice will be provided via the account portal and/or via an email to the email address Gruntwork has on file. For other revisions, Gruntwork will update the effective date of these Terms at the top of the page. Gruntwork encourages you to check the effective date of these Terms whenever you visit Gruntwork’s website or account portal. Your continued access or use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any revisions. If you do not agree to the revisions, you should stop using the Services and Gruntwork is not obligated to provide you with the Services.

<!--Plain English:
Gruntwork owns all rights to any data we collect regarding performance, availability, or system integrity.
-->

As between the parties, Gruntwork exclusively owns all right, title and interest in and to the Services, System Data and Gruntwork’s Confidential Information. “System Data” means data collected by Gruntwork regarding the Gruntwork Product that may be used to generate logs, statistics or reports regarding the performance, availability, usage, integrity or security of the Services.

### 3.2. License Grant

<!--Plain English:
Your license to our products and services depends on which services you purchase from Gruntwork.
-->

The scope of your license will depend on the products and features you purchase from Gruntwork as set forth in the applicable Order Form.

#### 3.2.1. License to Library Products

<!--Plain English:
If you purchase a "Library Product" (Library), we give you a broad license to the code for use with your own infrastructure, and per [Section 4.4] you can continue using it even if you cancel. But you can't share the code with another company, resell it, publish it as open source, or try to sub-license it.
-->

The Library Products include AWS IaC Library, which is a collection of infrastructure code created and updated from time to time by Gruntwork, and which is made available via the private git repositories listed at https://www.gruntwork.io/legal/library-repos. Gruntwork hereby grants you a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (other than as specifically set forth in Section 15 below), non-sublicensable license to use, install, test, execute, perform, and copy the Library Products exclusively for your internal business use, and to create derivative works or otherwise modify the Library Products purely for your internal business purposes (the “Library License”). For the avoidance of doubt, you may not distribute any Library Products to a third-party. Your use of the Library Products is solely for your internal business use only. Additionally, the Library License is granted on a per User basis, and you must purchase and maintain a valid license for each User who accesses the Library Products. The Library License is only granted to you if your applicable Order Form explicitly includes reference to a Library Product.

#### 3.2.2. License to Subscription Products

<!--Plain English:
If you purchase a "Subscription Product" (Gruntwork Pipelines, Gruntwork Patcher, Gruntwork Catalog, Gruntwork Runbooks, support services, or access to KodeKloud), these products are provided to you on a subscription basis and you will lose access if you cancel.
-->

The Subscription Products include AWS Accelerator, AWS IaC Library, and Terragrunt Scale. These products are provided to you as hosted software, self-hosted software, pre-built binaries, or access to a collection of pre-written code. Subscription Products also include support services.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Gruntwork will make the Subscription Products available to you during the term of your applicable Order Form, and hereby grants you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Subscription Products for your business purposes (the “Subscription License”). No other license rights will apply to the Subscription Products. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Post-Termination License (set forth in Section 4.4) does not apply to the Subscription License. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in your Order Form, your access and use of the Services are subject to the Subscription License.

### 3.3. Professional Services

<!--Plain English:
We can optionally provide you with Professional Services to help you with the Gruntwork services.
-->

In connection with providing you the Services, Gruntwork may offer initial configuration assistance, Customer training, migration or other professional services that Gruntwork furnishes to Customer related to the Services (the “Professional Services”). If applicable, Gruntwork will use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) perform Professional Services and (2) deliver any deliverables in conformance with Gruntwork's provision of the Professional Services. Customer will give Gruntwork timely access to customer materials reasonably needed for Professional Services and/or the deliverables, and Gruntwork will use the customer materials only for purposes of providing Professional Services. Except as set forth otherwise and further described in a statement of work (“SOW”), (A) as between the parties, Gruntwork shall solely and exclusively own all right, title, interest in the Professional Services and (B) to the extent Gruntwork creates any work product or code on behalf of Customer in furtherance of the Professional Services (the “Deliverables”), and subject to the restriction set forth in Section 7.2(c), Gruntwork grants Customer a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use the Deliverables created from the Professional Services.

### 3.4 Customer Contributions to Gruntwork

<!--Plain English:
Any modifications you make to our code in your own code repos are your intellectual property and Gruntwork will not have any rights to it.
However, if you find a bug in our code or see an opportunity for an improvement and you decide to contribute some code back to us via a GitHub pull request, we’ll want to share that code with all our customers, so we’ll own the code you submit. If you don't want us to own the code, just don't contribute it our repos.
-->

Nothing in this Agreement requires you to contribute to the Services; however, if you choose to contribute any intellectual property via a submission to a Gruntwork source code repository (for example, via a GitHub pull request), Gruntwork will own such contribution (“Gruntwork-Owned Contribution”). You warrant that Gruntwork-Owned Contributions do not include any of your Confidential Information (as defined in Section 7), and you hereby assign to Gruntwork all rights in the Gruntwork-Owned Contribution, including, without limitation, all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark rights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights to and in the Services in the United States and all other countries, including the right to pursue patents, utility models, or industrial design applications in the United States and all other countries, and will do everything reasonably possible (when requested by Gruntwork, and at Gruntwork’s expense) to carry out in good faith the intent of this clause. Nothing in this Agreement requires you to provide access to Gruntwork to your source code repository, unless otherwise expressly required under the Agreement of a specific Service that you have utilized.

### 3.5. License to Customer Information

You grant Gruntwork a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, copy, process, transmit, and display information, data, and other content provided or submitted by you or your Authorized Users to or through the Services (and modification and derivatives thereof) (collectively, “Customer Information”) solely for the purpose of Gruntwork providing the Services to you in accordance with this Agreement.

### 3.6. Gruntwork Use of Open Source Software

<!--Plain English:
Some of the code in our library contains open source tools that use a “copyleft” license like GPL (e.g. `wget`). We won’t modify these tools in such a way that we trigger a “viral” obligation that requires our code (or your derivative works from our code) to be released as GPL. We’ll always comply with Gruntwork’s Open Source Usage Policy when using open source software.
-->

You acknowledge that from time to time Gruntwork may utilize third-party software, such as publicly-distributed software (e.g., third-party software commonly known as “free software” or “open source software” subject to one or more third-party license agreements), or other third-party documentation and information in connection with providing the Library Products. Gruntwork may incorporate such third-party software into the Library Products or make use of such third-party software in the Library Products. If the third-party software uses a GPL, LGPL, or MPL license, Gruntwork will ensure the use of that third-party software in the Library Products does not trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. Gruntwork will at all times use such third-party software only in accordance with Gruntwork’s Open Source Usage Policy located at https://gruntwork.io/open-source-policy, which may be updated from time to time but at all times will meet industry standards.

### 3.7. Your Use of Open Source Software

<!--Plain English:
Gruntwork has made a commitment not to modify any open source code in a way that triggers a “viral” obligation.
Here, we ask you to do the same. In practice, this means that if you modify our code, you can’t modify any GPL code that we distribute with the code. For example, we use `wget` in many of our bash scripts. If you need to make a change to how we use `wget`, don’t modify `wget` itself because the GPL license on `wget` will then require that all the code that uses `wget` be made GPL as well.
-->

You also acknowledge that, under the terms of the Library License granted herein, you agree not to distribute the Library Products or any derivative of the Library Products in any way and, as such, acknowledge and agree that you will not “convey” any Library Products or derivative of the Library Products in a manner that would trigger GPL, LGPL, or MPL obligations commonly referred to as “viral” obligations. In the event you produce any derivative work from any portion of the Library Products, or otherwise modify the Library Products, you shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such derivatives or modifications comply with the terms of the licenses to any third-party software incorporated into the Library Products.

### 3.8. Feedback

<!--Plain English:
If you give us a great idea, we get to use it and share it!
-->

You hereby grant Gruntwork a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use, reproduce, translate, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, and incorporate into the Services, any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback provided by you or your Authorized Users relating to Services. Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this Agreement, this irrevocable license will continue after the expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

### 3.9 Logo usage

<!--Plain English:
We may use your logo to identify you as a Gruntwork customer. You can ask us to stop using it at any time.
-->

Gruntwork may use Customer’s name, logo, and trademarks (collectively, “Customer Marks”) to identify Customer as a Gruntwork customer on Gruntwork’s website, marketing materials, and customer lists. Such use shall be limited to factual statements and in accordance with any usage guidelines Customer provides. Gruntwork shall not modify or use the Customer Marks in any manner that is misleading or disparaging. Upon written request from Customer, Gruntwork will promptly cease or modify such use to the extent commercially feasible.

## 4. Term and Termination

### 4.1. Term

<!--Plain English:
Your use of the services requires a subscription. Your subscription will automatically renew for successive terms unless you tell us otherwise at least 15 days before it renews.
Note that prior to May 2, 2024, these terms of service specified an initial and renewal term of 12 months.
-->

The term of this Agreement will become effective on the date these Terms are accepted by you and continue until your account is terminated as set forth below.. Except as set forth in an Order Form, the term of your Agreement will automatically renew for successive renewal terms equal to the length of the initial term, unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least fifteen (15) days prior to the end of the then-current term (each, a “Renewal Term”).

### 4.2. Termination

<!--Plain English:
If either of us fails to live up to these terms, we have to let the other one know, and if the problem isn’t fixed within 30 days, the agreement between us will terminate. Under certain very specific circumstances, we can suspend or terminate your account immediately.
-->

Each party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party if there are no Order Forms then in effect. Each party may also terminate this Agreement or the applicable Order Form upon written notice in the event (a) the other party commits any material breach of this Agreement or the applicable Order Form and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach or (b) subject to applicable law, upon the other party’s liquidation, commencement of dissolution proceedings or assignment of substantially all its assets for the benefit of creditors, or if the other party become the subject of bankruptcy or similar proceeding that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days. Gruntwork may further terminate this Agreement if (a) we, in our sole discretion and in good faith, believe you have breached your warranty set forth in Section 10 or (b) if, in our sole discretion, we believe that you or your Authorized Users’ continued use of the Services creates legal risk for Gruntwork or presents a threat to the security of the Services or other Gruntwork customers.

### 4.3. Effects of Suspension or Termination

If, at any time, any of the Services or the Agreement (or any portion hereof) are suspended or terminated for any reason, you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary, all Sections of this Agreement that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect after termination of the Agreement, shall survive termination .

### 4.4. Post-Termination Library License

<!--Plain English:
If you purchase a Library buyout option (or if you signed up on or before May 2, 2024), even if you cancel, you can keep using all the Library Product code you had access to at the time of cancellation at no additional cost.
We recommend that before termination, you clone any Gruntwork repos and update your infrastructure code to remove all references to private Gruntwork repos.
-->

If, at any time, all or any portion of the Agreement or your Services are terminated (other than by Gruntwork for cause), the Library License will remain in effect for all of your forks of the Library Products source code repositories as of the termination date. Gruntwork recommends that, prior to the termination date, you fork any Gruntwork source code repositories and update your infrastructure code to remove all references to any private Gruntwork source code repositories.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Library License set forth in this Section 4.4 is only valid to Customers who have purchased (and paid for) a perpetual usage right to the Library Products from Gruntwork, or to customers who purchased Gruntwork on or before May 2, 2024. 

## 5. Compensation and Invoicing

All fees are quoted and payable in United States dollars, all payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly set forth herein, all fees paid are non-refundable. If Customer has selected a payment plan and provided its payment information to Gruntwork, then Customer (a) represents and warrants to Gruntwork that such information is true and that Customer is authorized to use the payment instrument, (b) will promptly update its account information with any changes to its payment instrument information, and (c) hereby authorizes Gruntwork (including through its payment processor, in which case Customer hereby agrees to the applicable terms and policies of such payment processor) to bill your payment instrument in advance in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan.

The late fee will be either 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by law, whichever is less

-->

## 6. Third-Party Applications

-->

From time to time, Gruntwork may offer to you the ability to access, or the Services may be integrated or interact with, third party applications, websites, and services (“Third-Party Applications”) to make the Services available to you. These Third-Party Applications may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies.

The Agreements, including, without limitation, this Agreement, constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties, and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement by a Party will not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights by such Party. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect, and the Parties will, in good faith, attempt to modify the invalid provision so it becomes a valid provision.
